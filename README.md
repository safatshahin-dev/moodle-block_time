Time is a Moodle block to show the time to the user using an analog clock. The time is user time, not the Moodle timezone or forced time from site administration.
This block relies on the user location and gets the time for the user using JavaScript Date Reference. No setup required to make this block work. Just need to add it in a page and ready to go.

A digital version with an ability to change it from settings is coming soon.
